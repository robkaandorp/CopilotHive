## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2025-07-15

### Added

**Composer Agent & Chat UI.** A conversational Composer agent at `/composer` provides streaming chat for goal decomposition and management. It offers goal CRUD tools (create, approve, update, delete, cancel, list, search), codebase inspection (read_file, glob, grep), five read-only git tools, web search and fetch via Ollama, phase output inspection with brain and worker prompt access, repository listing, release management tools, and interactive questions with markdown rendering. The chat persists sessions across page navigations and automatically recovers from context overflow by resetting the session.

**Brain & Orchestration.** The Brain uses SharpCoder's CodingAgent with a single persistent session that carries context across all goals, replacing per-goal session management. It has read-only file access to all target repositories cloned eagerly at startup, automatic context compaction at 80% capacity, and session persistence for crash recovery. Goals process sequentially so the Brain accumulates learnings. The Brain generates concise commit messages for squash merges with fallback to description-based messages.

**Dashboard & UI.** A Goals browser at `/goals` lists all goals with status, scope, creation date, and iteration count. The Goal detail view shows full state including brain and worker prompts, iteration history, and merge commits. A Planning phase tab displays a dependency visualization graph and a configuration page shows brain model, worker replicas, and git branch settings. The UI displays the current version in the footer and a releases page lists all releases with their dates and scopes.

**Goal Management.** A SQLite-backed goal store serves as the primary persistence layer for all goal data. A REST API exposes CRUD operations for goal creation, approval, deletion, cancellation, and revert. Goals support dependency linking and scoping into patch, feature, and breaking-change categories. Release tracking maintains goal-to-release associations, and status validation ensures only valid state transitions are permitted.

**Worker Sessions.** Per-role worker sessions persist context across iterations, enabling workers to maintain state within a goal. Workers communicate over gRPC for efficient streaming and binary serialization.

**Pipeline Features.** The documentation writing phase runs conditionally based on goal scope. Squash merges are used for all goal completions, with merge commit tracking persisting worker output across iterations. Iteration summaries provide a bird's-eye view of goal progress, and the improvement phase runs non-blocking so it does not delay goal completion.

**Infrastructure.** GitHub Actions provides continuous integration with multi-arch Docker images supporting both amd64 and arm64. HTTP resilience patterns handle transient failures gracefully. Structured logging captures all system events in a consistent format.

**Observability.** Context usage is logged for every phase to track token consumption. Phase duration tracking measures end-to-end latency per phase. Worker utilization metrics and elapsed time are recorded for all pipeline stages.

### Changed

The SharpCoder dependency was updated to a newer version with improved code generation. The pipeline phase order was adjusted so documentation writing runs conditionally based on goal scope. SQLite became the primary goal store, replacing the previous file-based approach. The generic worker pool replaces fixed-role Docker Compose services, allowing a single worker type to handle multiple roles. The logging infrastructure migrated to structured logging with consistent field formatting across all services.

### Fixed

Goal cancellation now properly terminates all in-progress phases and clears pending work. Session context no longer leaks between unrelated goals. Worker gRPC connections are properly closed when goals complete or are cancelled. The Brain's context compaction now correctly preserves critical state while trimming peripheral information. Repository cloning no longer fails on repositories with unusually deep directory structures. Merge commit detection now correctly identifies squash merges versus regular commits.

### Removed

Legacy CLI mode and all associated orchestrator code have been removed in favor of the server-driven model. Per-goal session management was replaced by the Brain's persistent session, eliminating the WORKER_ROLE environment variable and fixed-role service definitions. Complex auto-rebase handling, the metrics folder placeholder, and unused abstraction layers for legacy Copilot clients were removed. The --serve flag is no longer needed as server mode is now default.
